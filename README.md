# Auracast Demo
This is a modification of Zeyphr samples to quickly and transprently see how an auracast broadcast works, if your board picks ups an auracast broadcast, and get all the details of said broadcast.  
I noticed my phone is cabaple of Auracast broadcast and I wanted to see the details of it so I investigated it (couldn't find the details of the broadcast online) so I made this.


When it is actively reciving audio (length non-zero) and when it is not.
